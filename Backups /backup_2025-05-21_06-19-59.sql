94	ABS	Front/Middle Abs (Rectus Abdominis)	Exercise Ball Reverse Crunch	First get down on your hands and knees with your hands directly under your shoulders, and reach your shins and the top side of your feet back up onto an exercise ball, as if you are about to do a high plank/pushup from the top of the ball (make sure to keep a straight line from your head, through your shoulders, hips, knees and ankles). From here, pull your knees up to your chest, bringing the top side of your feet and toes more onto the exercise ball (your butt can lift up towards the ceiling a little bit as well). Kick your feet back over the ball, straightening your legs and bringing your shins back onto the top of the ball.	3
95	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Cable Torso Rotation	Stand perpendicularly next to a cable tower with the cable setup to about shoulder height with a single handle attachment. Take a step away from the tower so there is some tension on the cable. Grip the handle with your hands and fingers laced together or with one hand overlapping the other (whichever you prefer). Bend in your knees and keep a slight bend in your elbows, keeping your arms directly out in front of your chest as if you are hugging a barrel. Keep your feet parallel with your toes facing forward and your hips square with your feet throughout the movement (no twisting your hips!). Rotate your torso and shoulders a full 180 degrees, pulling the cable across the front side of your body. Slowly allow the weight 180 degrees back to the starting position. Do this for both sides.	2
96	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Side Crunch	Lay on one side with your knees bent about 90 degrees with your legs stacked on top of each other. Keep your bottom arm flat on the floor in front of you to be utilized as a kickstand (only if you need it!). Bring your top hand onto your head with your fingertips just behind your ears and your elbow facing the ceiling. Reach your top elbow down to your hip, bringing your bottom shoulder blade off of the floor. Allow your bottom shoulder back down to the floor.	1
97	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Side V-Up	Lay on one side on the flat part of your butt with your knees straight and your legs stacked on top of each other. Keep your bottom arm flat on the floor in front of you to be utilized as a kickstand (only if you need it!). Bring your top hand onto your head with your fingertips just behind your ears and your elbow facing the ceiling. Bring your legs up towards the ceiling along with your torso while reaching your elbow to your knee, bringing your bottom shoulder blade off of the floor. Allow your bottom shoulder back down to the floor along with your legs while trying to keep your legs straight throughout the movement.	3
98	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Russian Twist	Take a seat on the floor with your legs out in front of you with your feet together and your knees slightly bent. Keep your torso upright, and lean back slightly while keeping your chest up and shoulders pinched in your back. Tap your fingers on one side of your hips, rotate your shoulders 180 degrees to your opposite side, arching your hands over your legs, and tap your hands on the other side of your hips. Continue doing this, alternating from one side to the other. To make this more challenging, you can hold on to a weighted medicine ball with your hands.	2
99	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Standing Dumbbell Side Bend	Stand tall with your feet about hip width apart and your feet in line with each other. Hang on to a dumbbell with one hand with your palm facing your opposite side. Slide the dumbbell down your leg until it is just above your knee on the same side as the hand holding the dumbbell. Crunch your torso, pulling your opposite shoulder down towards your hip on your opposite side. Alternate from one side to the other. Do this while holding on to the dumbbell on each side.	1
100	ABS	Side Abs (Obliques)	Side Plank	Lay flat on your side and bring your bottom elbow directly under your shoulder and your bottom hand directly out in front of your elbow and your top arm/hand flat on your top side. Keep your legs and feet stacked on top of each other. Keep your head neutral, and raise your hips from the floor until your body is in a straight line from your head through your shoulders, hips, knees and ankles. Keep your bellybutton tucked in, squeeze through your butt, and tuck your tailbone. Hold for as long as your comfortable. To reduce difficulty, this can be done from your knees (Keep a straight line from your head through your shoulders, hips and knees).	2
101	FULL BODY	All Muscle Groups	Barbell Deadlift	Stand tall while hanging onto a barbell with your hands just outside of shoulder width apart with an overhand grip. Keeping your chest up and your spine and head neutral, push your butt straight back to the wall behind you, bend your knees, and hinge your torso forward bringing your chest closer to the floor. Allow the barbell to slide down the front side of your legs while hanging your arms straight holding onto the bar, and try to keep the barbell as close to your shins as possible only going about halfway down your shins. From here, begin to reverse the hinge and pull your head back up to the ceiling while still keeping your torso neutral, and once the barbell passes your knees push your hips forward and squeeze through your butt until you are standing tall again.	3
102	FULL BODY	All Muscle Groups	Barbell Back Squat	Bring a barbell onto the top of your back resting across your shoulders with your hands hanging onto the bar with an overhand grip just outside of shoulder width apart. Stand tall with your feet flat on the floor about shoulder width apart with your toes facing forward or slightly out to the side. Keep your chest up and your spine and head neutral with your shoulders pinched in your back and your core tight (like a tree trunk!), push your butt straight back to the wall behind you, bend your knees, and allow your body to lower down to the floor until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Press your feet flat into the ground, stretching your head up to the ceiling, until your legs are straight and you are standing upright.	3
103	FULL BODY	All Muscle Groups	Barbell Snatch	Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with the barbell on the ground in front of you. Bend down and grip the barbell with an overhand grip and your hands just outside of shoulder width apart. Stand up and lift the barbell off the ground, keeping your back straight and your core engaged while keeping the bar close to your shins. Begin the second pull after the bar passes your knees by explosively extending your hips, knees, and ankles, while keeping your arms straight and stretching your head up to the ceiling. As the barbell passes your hips, shrug your shoulders and pull yourself under the barbell, catching it in a squat position with the bar over your head. Stand up, fully extending your hips and knees, and finish the movement by holding the barbell overhead with your arms straight. Lower the barbell down to your chest and back to the ground, being careful to maintain control throughout the movement.	3

105	FULL BODY	All Muscle Groups	Barbell Jerk	Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with the barbell on the front side of your shoulders in the front rack position and your hands just outside of shoulder width apart. Dip by bending your knees slightly, keeping your hips back, and your chest up. Press through your heels, extending your legs and pushing your body upward as you press the barbell overhead. Split your legs by quickly moving one foot forward flat and one foot backward onto your back toes, allowing you to drop under the barbell and catch it in a stable position with your arms fully extended overhead. After you catch the barbell overhead, stand back up by driving through the legs and bring your feet next to each other returning to a stable position. Lower the barbell back to the front rack position or return it to the ground, being careful to maintain control throughout the movement.	3
106	FULL BODY	All Muscle Groups	Sprinting	Sprints can be done on either a treadmill or flat ground preferably on a track. Begin the sprint by leaning forward slightly and driving your knees upward as you push off the ground with your feet. Keep your arms bent at a 90-degree angle and pump them back and forth in a natural motion. As you build up speed, increase your stride length and frequency to maintain your momentum.
