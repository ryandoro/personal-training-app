## Why This Project
I built FitBaseAI after 13 years in the fitness industry to solve real-world challenges I experienced as a trainer and manager:
- Trainers wasting time writing repetitive workouts.  
- Losing track of progress and machine settings.  
- Gyms struggling with subscription flows and retention.  

This prototype shows how fitness workflows can be turned into scalable, intuitive software.

## Future Enhancements
- Visual progress charts for workout history and user stats  
- AI-driven workout adjustments to overcome injuries 
- Expanded analytics in the admin dashboard
