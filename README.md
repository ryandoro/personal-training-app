## Why This Project
I built FitBaseAI after 13 years in the fitness industry to solve real-world challenges I experienced as a trainer and manager:
- Trainers wasting time writing repetitive workouts.  
- Losing track of progress and machine settings.  
- Gyms struggling with subscription flows and retention.  

This prototype shows how fitness workflows can be turned into scalable, intuitive software.

## Future Enhancements
- Visual progress charts for workout history and user stats  
- AI-driven workout adjustments to overcome injuries 
- Expanded analytics in the admin dashboard  

### Registration safeguards
- Run the migration in `sql/202421_create_registration_attempts.sql` to enable rate-limited logging for signup attempts.
- Provide Cloudflare Turnstile keys via the `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` environment variables to enable the human-verification widget on `/register`.
- Optional environment overrides let you tune throttling thresholds: `REGISTRATION_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_HOURS`, `REGISTRATION_RATE_LIMIT_PER_EMAIL`, and `REGISTRATION_RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP`.
